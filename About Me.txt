# About Me
## My Interests
* Music - Music is like therapy to me. If I'm feeling down, I can listen to an upbeat song and my whole mood will change. If I need comfort for my soul, I can listen to a song that glorifies God and be encouraged.
* Dancing - I like to feel music in my body. I feel this when I dance. I imagine I'm a part of the song temporarily when I dance and it makes me feel energized. 
* Walking - Walking and looking at the beauty of this world is very inspiring to me. I like to see nature and look up at the clouds and let my mind release any troubles I may have.
## Websites I Recommend
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) I enjoy seeing what other people have to say and getting new ideas for things. I also like it when I find meaningful sayings to meditate on.
* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) I love to shop online to avoid crowds. I also can find things to buy that I may never find in a traditional store in my area. Amazon is worldwide shopping at your fingertips!
